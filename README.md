This repository demonstrates a common mistake in Rust programming involving unsafe pointer manipulation with vectors.  The `bug.rs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.rs` offers a safe and correct alternative.  Directly modifying a vector's raw pointer is highly discouraged and prone to errors unless you have an exceptional understanding of memory management in Rust. This example highlights the importance of using safe and idiomatic Rust whenever possible.
